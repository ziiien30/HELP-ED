   <p>Eating disorders are a group of related conditions involving extreme food and weight issues, but each disorder has unique symptoms and diagnosis criteria. <br><br>Here are <b>six</b> of the most common eating disorders and their symptoms.</p>

      <h1>1. Anorexia Nervosa</h1>
      <p>Anorexia nervosa is likely the most well-known eating disorder. It generally develops during adolescence or young adulthood and tends to affect more women than men. People with anorexia generally view themselves as overweight, even if they’re dangerously underweight. They tend to constantly monitor their weight, avoid eating certain types of foods, and severely restrict their calorie intake.</p>
      <p>Common symptoms of anorexia nervosa include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>very restricted eating patterns</li>
        <li>a heavy influence of body weight or perceived body shape on self-esteem</li>
        <li>a distorted body image, including denial of being seriously underweight</li>
        <li>a relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a healthy weight</li>
        <li>intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors to avoid gaining weight, despite being underweight</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>2. Bulimia Nervosa</h1>
      <p>Bulimia nervosa is another well-known eating disorder. People with bulimia frequently eat unusually large amounts of food in a specific period of time. During a binge, the person usually feels that they cannot stop eating or control how much they are eating. Symptoms may appear very similar to those of the binge eating or purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals with bulimia usually maintain a relatively typical weight rather than losing a large amount of weight.</p>
      <p>Common symptoms of bulimia nervosa include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>recurrent episodes of binge eating with a feeling of lack of control</li>
		<li>recurrent episodes of inappropriate purging behaviors to prevent weight gain</li>
		<li>a fear of gaining weight, despite having a typical weight</li>
		<li>self-esteem overly influenced by body shape and weight</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>3. Binge Eating Disorder</h1>
      <p>Binge eating disorder (BED) is a type of feeding and eating disorder. People with BED may eat a lot of food in a short amount of time, even if they aren’t hungry. Emotional stress or destress often plays a role and might trigger a period of binge eating.</p>
	  <p>People with BED often experience feelings of extreme unhappiness and distress about their overeating, body shape, and weight. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa however, they do not regularly use compensatory behaviors to get rid of the food by inducing vomiting, fasting, exercising or laxative misuse. </p>
      <p>Common symptoms of binge eating disorder include :</p>
      <ul>
       <li>eating much more rapidly than normal</li>
		<li>feeling a lack of control during episodes of binge eating</li>
		<li>eating alone due to feelings of embarrassment and shame</li>
		<li>feelings of distress, such as shame, disgust, or guilt, when thinking about the binge eating behavior</li>
		<li>no use of purging behaviors, such as calorie restriction, vomiting, excessive exercise, or laxative or diuretic use, to compensate for the binge eating</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>4. Pica</h1>
      <p>Pica is an eating disorder in which a person repeatedly eats things that are not food with no nutritional value. The behavior persists over at least one month and is severe enough to warrant clinical attention.This disorder occurs most often in children and pregnant women. It’s usually temporary. A person diagnosed with pica may regularly eat things such as : soap, buttons, clay, hair, dirt, sand, paint, glue, chalk and more.</p>
	<p>Pica may first occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, although childhood onset is most common. Pica often occurs along with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, but can occur in otherwise typically developing children.</p>

    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>5. Rumination Disorder</h1>
      <p>Rumination disorder, also known as rumination syndrome, is a rare and chronic condition. This disorder can develop during infancy, childhood, or adulthood. In infants, it tends to develop between 3 and 12 months of age and often disappears on its own. Children and adults with the condition usually require therapy to resolve it.</p>
	  <p>It describes a condition in which a person regurgitates food they have previously chewed and swallowed, re-chews it, and then either re-swallows it or spits it out. This rumination typically occurs within the first 30 minutes after a meal. </p>
	  <p>Common Symptoms of rumination disorder include:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>repeated regurgitation of undigested food</li>
		<li>bad breath</li>
		<li>stomach aches or indigestion</li>
		<li>tooth decay</li>
		<li>dry mouth or lips</li>

    <div class="card-content">
      <h1>6.Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)</h1>
      <p>ARFID is a recently defined eating disorder that involves a disturbance in eating resulting in persistent failure to meet nutritional needs and extreme picky eating.  Individuals with this disorder experience disturbed eating due to either a lack of interest in eating or a distaste for certain smells, tastes, colors, textures, or temperatures.</p>
	  <p>Common Symptoms of ARFID include:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>weight loss or poor development for age and height</li>
		<li>nutrient deficiencies or dependence on supplements or tube feeding</li>
		<li>eating habits that interfere with typical social functions, such as eating with others</li>
		<li>avoidance or restriction of food intake that prevents the person from eating enough calories or nutrients</li>

      <h1>7.Other eating disorders</h1>
      <p>This diagnostic category includes eating disorders or disturbances of eating behavior that cause distress and impair family, social or work function but do not fit the other categories listed here. In some cases, this is because the frequency of the behavior does not meet the diagnostic threshold (e.g., the frequency of binges in bulimia or binge eating disorder) or the weight criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa are not met.</p>
		
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
		<li>Purging disorder. Individuals with purging disorder often use purging behaviors, such as vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or excessive exercising, to control their weight or shape. However, they do not binge.</li>
		<li>Night eating syndrome. Individuals with this syndrome frequently eat excessively at night, often after awakening from sleep.
</li>
		<li>Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). While it is not found in the DSM-5, this category includes any other conditions that have symptoms similar to those of an eating disorder but don’t fit any of the disorders above.</li>
