	   <h2><font color="#7895CB">About Eating Disorders</font></h2>
   <p>Eating disorders &#40;ED&#41; are a serious mental health condition that cause unhealthy eating habits to develop. And is not due to a character flaw, weakness, being ungrateful, or just a lack of control. They might start with an obsession with food, body weight, or body shape. People with eating disorders can have a variety of symptoms. Common symptoms include severe restriction of food, food binges, and purging behaviors like vomiting or overexercising. </p>
	   
	   <p>In severe cases, eating disorders can cause serious health consequences and may even result in death if left untreated. <font color="#FF6347">In fact, eating disorders are among the deadliest mental illnesses, second to opioid overdose.</font> Because of the lack of awareness, and stigma, only a small minority of people with an eating disorder receive mental health treatment, with many cases going undetected by health care professionals. Consequently eating disorders often take a chronic course and resulting in serious physical health problems.</p>

	   <h2><font color="#4A55A2">What causes eating disorders?</font></h2>
   <p>While it is unclear why an individual develops an eating disorder. Most specialists believe that eating disorders develop as a result of a combination of psychological, environmental, and genetic factors. </p>

    <h5><u><font color="#02A8A8" size="+2">Biological Factors</font></u></h5>
	<p>Biological risk factors for eating disorders involve various genetic factors, including tendencies toward medical and mental illnesses. People with a family history of mental illness are more susceptible to experiencing mental health issues themselves, which can include eating disorders. Eating disorders often co-occur with conditions like depression, anxiety, or substance use problems. </p>

    <h5><u><font color="#91C788" size="+2">Psychological Factors</font></u></h5>
	<p>Psychological factors for eating disorders involve co-occurring diagnoses with other disorders. Certain personality traits, like perfectionism, low self-worth, distorted body image, and impulsivity, can increase the risk of developing an eating disorder. Additionally, experiencing past or present trauma can also contribute to the development of disordered eating beliefs or patterns.</p>

    <h5><u><font color="#02A8A8" size="+2">Environmental Factors</font></u></h5>
	<p> Environmental factors influencing eating disorders encompass the surroundings of an individual. This involves family dynamics, where beliefs and discussions about weight, food, and self-image can be linked to eating disorder diagnoses. Social influences from peers, social media, television/movies, and consumer culture are also associated with an increased risk of developing eating disorders.</p>
